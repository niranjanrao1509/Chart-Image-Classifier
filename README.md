# Chart-Image-Classifier

Implemented a simple 2 layer CNN, finetuned a ResNet pretrained model and implement a vision transformer.  
To run the ipynb make sure to sort the data using the first 3 blocks of code in TASK_1-3. This will segregate the data into coreesponding class folders which is a requirement of Pytorch.

- __Task_1-3__ 
  - Loading and Sorting data into ImageFolders
  - Training a simple 2 Layer Convolutional Network
  - Finetuning a pretrained ResNet - 50
- __Transformer__
  - Implemented Vision Transformer with 2 Multi Head Attention Layers
  - Experimented with GANs
