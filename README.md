# Chart-Image-Classifier

Implemented a simple 2 layer CNN, finetuned a ResNet pretrained model and implement a vision transformer.
To run the ipynb make sure to sort the data using the first 3 blocks of code in TASK_1-3. This will segregate the data into coreesponding class folders which is a requirement of Pytorch.
